- The client and server programs were written and tested using Python2 so please use Python 2 to run the programs.

- Please run the client.py program without inputting any command line arguments! The server and port are already a part of the client.py code, and there will be a prompt for the user to enter a nickname

- This program may work sometimes, and may not work properly other times. Whenever a client joins or creates a channel the server will send a messge that the client will print out on the screen.
ex: 'You are now in Channel CEG4188'... If the first word of this message is 'ok' then the program is not running correctly and should be restarted ex:
'ok You are now in Channel CEG4188'
Otherwise the program is working properly. This issue is probably due to a problem with the OS being used to test the code. 

- The majority of this code was written and tested on MAC OS.
